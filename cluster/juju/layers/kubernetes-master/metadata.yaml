  Kubernetes is an open-source platform for deplying, scaling, and operations
  of appliation containers across a cluster of hosts. Kubernetes is portable
  in that it works with public, private, and hybrid clouds. Extensible through
  a pluggable infrastructure. Self healing in that it will automatically
  restart and place containers on healthy nodes if a node ever goes away.
